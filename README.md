# Etch-a-Sketch

This project will build an Etch-A-Sketch using Javascript. It is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. 

The Resize button will change the resolution of the canvas, by increasing the number of squares. However, the grid size will not change, so the increased squares will fit in the same area as before.

The Multicolor toggle button will change the color of your "brush" from black to a random RGB value.
